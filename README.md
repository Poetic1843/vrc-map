# vrc-map

A map of the field for the VRC game Tipping Point. This map is ideal for doing things like planning skills routes and 
for making images for the notebook. You can try it out at https://poetic1843.github.io/vrc-map/

### Controls

- Click and drag to add a point.
- Shift + Drag to move a point or gameobject on the field (drag to trashcan to delete)
- Hold CTRL to disable the grid
- Hold ALT to lock the grid to your last placed point
- Press the number keys to switch to a different step to color your lines differently
- Edit the text box that says `slot1` to change your save slot
- Press the `Delete Save` button to delete your current save
- Press the `Delete All Saves` button to clear all your saves

### Project Goals
This is in no paticular order

- Add things like moving lifts and a keyframe system to allow for adding in when different mechanisms should activate
- Add more complex movement like [BÃ©zier Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)
- Exporting to a progam for quick and dirty program creation
- Support for next year's game as this was made late in the 2021-2022 season
- And more!
